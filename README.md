 ## How to use the engine

The Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is a standard protocol used to communicate with
a chess engine, and is the recommended way to do so for typical graphical user interfaces
(GUI) or chess tools. Alexandria implements the majority of its options as described
in [the UCI protocol](https://www.shredderchess.com/download/div/uci.zip).

  
## Acknowledgements

* CodeMonkeyKing for his bbc chess engine from which i learnt how bitboards work and several refined search techniques
* The whole Stockfish Discord server and Disservin in particular for the sharing of code and the avaliability in answering questions
* A giant thanks to Luecx that helped me immensely in the process of setting up the NNUE and gave me some training data generated by Koivisto
* Lucex (again) and Jay Honnold for the wonderlud CudAD trainer that was used to train the NNUE https://github.com/Luecx/CudAD
