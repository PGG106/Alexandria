 ## Building

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/PGG106/Alexandria
$ cd alexandria/src
$ make 
$ ./Alexandria
```
 ## How to use the engine

The Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is a standard protocol used to communicate with
a chess engine, and is the recommended way to do so for typical graphical user interfaces
(GUI) or chess tools. Alexandria implements the majority of its options as described
in [the UCI protocol](https://www.shredderchess.com/download/div/uci.zip).

  
## Acknowledgements
This project would not have been possible without the following people
* BluefeverSoftware for his Vice chess engine from which i learnt the basic structure and functionality of a chess engine
* CodeMonkeyKing for his bbc chess engine from which i learnt how bitboards work and several refined search techniques
* The whole Stockfish Discord server and Disservin in particular for the sharing of code and the avaliability in answering questions
* A giant thanks to Luecx that helped me immensely in the process of setting up the NNUE and gave me some training data generated by Koivisto
* Lucex (again) and Jay Honnold for the wonderlud CudAD trainer that was used to train the NNUE https://github.com/Luecx/CudAD
* Andrew Grant for the OpenBench platform https://github.com/AndyGrant/OpenBench
* Morgan Houppin, author of Stash for his "option" code https://github.com/mhouppin/stash-bot
